Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Christopher E. French for the continuous support of my PhD research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. I could not have imagined having a better supervisor and mentor for my PhD study, as his guidance helped me performing the research and writing of this thesis.
My sincere thanks to Dr. Rojas and Dr. Janssen. It would not be possible to be here writing this thesis without the opportunity given to join their respective research teams, enlightening me during my first glances in research.
I thank my fellow labmates for the stimulating discussions, their constant support and encouragement and for all the fun we have had during the last four years. A special thanks to Alejandro, Chao-Kuo, Jan, Marcos, Prabu, Antreas, Dariusz, Paulina, Christopher, Eric, Florentina and Mengxi who helped me during different stages of my PhD. A special recognition to all master and undergraduate students formed in our lab, who motivated me with their enthusiasm and even sometimes silly questions. Thanks to Bethan, Konstantinos, Gedis, Athan, Franklin, Brendan, Teri, Niels, Alexander, Cal, Nuoya, Juro, Jovanna and Stefano. 
To my ELE-EAP mates and instructors: Yermek, Nurlan, Daniyar, Korlan, Mohammed, Dayoung, Dauren, Soyoung, Ainur, Kuanish, Bakyt, Aigerim, Philip, Peter and Barbara. And also to the CodeClan mates: Dhileas, Jennie, Rhiannon, Ric, Kostas, Jonathan, Kuba, Miles, David, Stephanie, Del, Aileen, and Mhairi.
Most importantly, I would like to thank my family for the unconditional support. To Griselda and Francisco who are my major motivation to succeed in life. To my dad and cousins who convinced me to visit Chile while doing my PhD. Specially to Camila and Cassandra. To my aunts and uncles for the love given. To all my friends who even though the distance always tried to keep in touch, an honorific mention to Valeska, Ariel and Cristian for their incredible support. Thanks also to Macarena, Leyla and Merari who kept me rational and sane during the harsh times. Finally, thanks to Maria Victoria who always believed in me even more than what I did myself. Thanks to all of you I am able to finish this PhD thesis and, hence, this is also part of your success. Your support and patience contributed to make the impossible possible.

This research would not be feasible without the support of the 'Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo (ANID, formerly CONICYT)' and its program 'Formaci√≥n de Capital Humano Avanzado' who made me a beneficiary of the 'Becas Chile-PhD 72170403'.
