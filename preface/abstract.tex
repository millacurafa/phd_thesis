While Synthetic Biology represents a promising approach to solve real-world problems, 
the use of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is still a cause of legal and environmental concerns. 
Cell-free systems (CFS) are an emerging technology where cell extracts are used instead of genetically-modified cells, 
thus, not presenting a "living prospect" applicable to current legal regulations.

Since there is a need for development of novel systems using the cell-free approach, and considering that most attempts have
been focused on mimicking normal cell behaviour. This work has as principal aim to generate modular cell-free and cell-based 
systems capable of not only detect variables present in the environment, such as heavy metals or antibiotics, but also analyse
 them via the usage of unnatural behaviours, such as logic gates.

In vivo logic gates, for instance, have proven difficult to combine into larger devices. 
Here it is explained a cell-based logic system, ParAlleL, which decomposes a large genetic circuit 
into a collection of small subcircuits working in parallel, responding each subcircuit to a different combination of inputs. 
A final global output is then generated by a combination of the responses. Using ParAlleL, for the first time a completely
functional 3-bit full adder and full subtractor were generated using \textit{Escherichia coli} cells, as well as a calculator-like
display that shows a numeric result, from 0 to 7, when the proper 3 bit binary input is introduced into the system. 
This parallel approach facilitates the design of cell-based logic gates by the decomposition of complex processes into their main
components, avoiding the need for complex genetic engineering and solving some legal limitations.

Cell-free systems, on the other hand, have emerged as a possible solution but much work is needed to optimize their functionality 
and simplify their usage for Synthetic Biology. Here it is presented a transcription-only genetic circuit (TXO), which is independent
of translation or post-translation maturation. RNA aptamers are used as reaction output allowing the generation of fast, reliable and
simple-to-design transcriptional units. TXO cell-free reactions and their possible applications become a promising new tool for fast
and simple bench-to-market genetic circuit and biosensor applications.

Additionally, it's shown a versatile cell-free system based on the master survivalist bacteria \textit{Cupriavidus  metallidurans} CH34,
able of not only sensing environmental variables, such as heavy metals, but also synthesize proteins and produce bioplastics. This novel 
cell-free  chassis  comes after the discovery of the unstable genome that this bacteria carries, which is also explained here, offering 
novel possibilities of development considering the cell free approach.
